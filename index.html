        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pumpkin spice latte Starbucks</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I've had several jobs overseeing duties at other technology companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, and google. I have plenty of experience using computer software as I also have a degree in the field. As for my business administration degree, I have plenty of experience caring for business missions to succeed and grow. I have also represented companies at product fairs to introduce their company. I am an excellent spokesman and can easily communicate with others. My first step into the real world of business after graduation was an internship with Google. It helped me expand my skills in telecommunications, digital marketing, and customer services. I also oversee any issues with employees needing adjustments with their job hours and vacation hours. I also would suggest people who created significant impacts for bonuses or higher job opportunities. I do move from compant to company to expand my knowledge and get different work experiences as much as possible.

 <br><br>

        For most of my work, I have traveled to other countries to oversee the production smoothly through its time, from parts to the stories. I have traveled to the U.K, India, and China. I do speak Spanish, and I'm learning Mandarin. As an individual, I plan to follow up the ranks and become a CEO. My mission is to be part of a company, and I plan to help it grow and live up to its name and improve any shape or form. Through partnerships from other countries, I learn that it’s best to check in person once to ensure that the association is up to a great degree and without any hesitations to switch or leave the company. I have kept in contact with other past associates and have made helpful connections which would also help in any situation.<br><br>

        As an individual, I love to connect with clients and learn more about them besides business; it’s better to start relationships. I love to travel to learn and experience other cultures; I’m an adventurous explorer of artifacts and archaeological sites. I have two dogs. I'm not married, and I don't plan to be. In my free time, I stock and share trades. My hobbies are fishing, painting, and swimming. I believe family and friendships are essential. I’ve always been interested in companies and how they started from small to big as Amazon. I also plan to start a project and start my own company with all the skills and knowledge I have collected to do a couple of restaurants. I even got introduced to this field by my father and brothers as they have degrees in computer software and engineering. My brothers also code for businesses. I live in the city and have a cabin in Big Bear to enjoy my weekends. I believe the skills I have picked over the years and through school and travels would contribute to the success of a company, industry, the expansion of a product, or starting with a brand new product, advertisement, or the funding needed to continue the quest.
